        <h2 class="section-heading">About me</h2>
        <p class="lead lead-about">My interest in web development started when I got to know some people on online forums that were web developers. Being impressed by their work, my curiosity made me take up some online courses where I discovered coding is one of the activities I cannot be pulled away from. The combination of creativity and problem solving clearly agreed with my personality and made me decide to join a Web Development Immersive Course at General Assembly. Now, I am seeking a role where I could further develop skills that I have acquired during the course and maybe also learn a new framework.  In a free time I also enjoy a good read or a PC game that would let me immerse myself in a fascinating story.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Hand-down</h2>
        <p class="lead">This is my latest project that was also the final project I had to do at General Assembly. After being introduced to Ruby and Rails we were required to create an application that implemented them in the backend, and AngularJS at the front. Purpose of my application was to create a place where people could buy and sell second-hand computer parts. One of the main features of my app is the in-messaging system so the prospective buyers could contact the seller. The logic was setup at the back end in Ruby and Rails. This was particularly challenging as I couldnâ€™t allow having multiple conversations between only two people. This problem was solved by setting up appropriate validation forms, as well as the set up of conversation and message controllers mutually dependent. </p>

        <h3 class="section-heading">Notitia</h3>
        <p class="lead">  It was a group project in which myself, and other two team members, made a social platform in which people can meet up and exchange their knowledge on a certain subject with other people. I was responsible for implementing Google Maps API and adjusting it so it would improve user experience and ease of locating other users willing to exchange their services.For example, while filling out the form the user is asked to pin point his desired location by either selecting it on a map, or by putting in the desired address that was automatically stored in a database, and later shown on a map. These features, along with calculating the distances between two users involved, required careful manipulation of many google map features and plugins. Such as geolocation, reverse geocoding, autocomplete for addresses, and geolib to calculate the distance between the users. </p>

        <h3 class="section-heading">Book-finder</h3>
        <p class="lead"> Our second project required us to create a RESTful up with at least one API hooked up, and a login and register form for the user.  I focused on creating a database for book exchange points where people could exchange books freely between each other. The two APIs I used were Google Books and Google Maps. Their main purpose was to improve user experience and help locate where a given book may be, by giving a search option for to book that the user wants to upload, and by giving it's location on the map.    </p>

        <h3 class="section-heading">Reversi Game</h3>
        <p class="lead">That was a first project we had to do at General Assembly that we were asked to do after only two weeks of learning how to code. The premise was simple. We come up with a game, then we code in Javascript. I decided to make Othello/Reversi board game in which each player has to flank enemies playing pieces in order to have fill out the board with as many pieces of his own.  <br> One of the biggest challenges was to create a system of coordinates that would allow implementing a game logic would be consistent with rules of the game. The solution to this problem was to calculate the distance between each piece by taking into account the index number of each square, and applying a set of rules to the code that would allow only legal move. </p>
